# Model Output Formats

As illustrated in the README.md, you can run our provided command after preparing your model output files as specified in this document. For example, below is our provided grading command for the Image2Text benchmark:

```
python -m mixeval_x.compute_metrics_mmu \
    --benchmark mixeval_x_image2text_close \
    --model_response_dir THE_PATH_TO_MODEL_OUTPUT_FOLDER \
    --models_to_eval \
        gemini_1_5_pro \
        gemini_1_5_flash
```

Here, the `--model_response_dir` specifies the parent directory of your model directory. Your model directory contains the model output files. The model directory name is your model name that will be specified by `--models_to_eval`. Generally, your prepared model output files should have a structure like this:

```
    â””â”€â”€ model_response_dir
        â””â”€â”€ your_model_name
            â”‚
            â”œâ”€â”€ file1.jsonl
            â”‚
            â””â”€â”€ file2.jsonl
            â”‚
            â””â”€â”€ ...
```

> The difference between model input (the benchmark data) and output (the model response file) is just the `"response"` field, i.e., each entry in your output file should keep all key-value pairs (including the 'id') of the input entry, with an additional `"response"` field representing the model's output.

ðŸš¨ **We show example model output structures and files in `mixeval_x/examples/`**.

The exact output structures and data formats are detailed below.

## MMU Tasks (Image2Text, Video2Text, and Audio2Text)

### Structure
```
    â””â”€â”€ model_response_dir
        â””â”€â”€ your_model_name
            â”‚
            â”œâ”€â”€ your_model_name_ff.jsonl
            â”‚
            â””â”€â”€ your_model_name_mp.jsonl
```
> Note that the Audio2Text benchmark doesn't have the multiple-choice subset, therefore the "`_mp`" file is not required.

### Output Data Format

Free-form (your_model_name_ff):
```
[
    {
        "id": "1", 
        "problem_type": "free-form", 
        "image_id": "1.jpg", 
        "prompt": "Where are the people that are standing looking at?", 
        "target": ["away"], 
        "benchmark_name": "GQA", 
        "response": "The kite"
    },
    ...
]
```

Multiple-choice (your_model_name_mp):
```
[
    {
        "problem_type": "single-choice", 
        "image_id": "1.jpg", 
        "prompt": "Is the man's face clearly visible in the image?", 
        "options": ["Yes", "No"], 
        "target": [1], 
        "benchmark_name": "Q-Bench", 
        "response": "B."
    },
    ...
]
```
